<p class="pull-quote-short">Feeling like you want to do something meaningful with your spare time? You’re in luck: Santa Fe is a hotspot for volunteerism.</p>

<p><span class="introParagraph-living">With hundreds of nonprofit organizations in the region, volunteer opportunities range from traditional to obscure in a multitude of areas, so even the pickiest of folks can find a way to give back to their community.</span></p>

<p>Animal lovers in Santa Fe have a broad assortment of volunteer options from which to choose. <b>The Santa Fe Animal Shelter and Humane Society</b> <em>(100 Caja del Rio Road, 983-4309)</em> not only provides opportunities for people ages 12 and older to give hands-on help with animals at the shelter, but also seeks volunteers for work that ranges from providing administrative assistance to photographing animals for the adoption website to sorting donations at the resale furniture shop, Look What the Cat Dragged In. Volunteers at <b>The Horse Shelter </b><em>(1600 Lena St. 471-6179)</em>, which rescues and rehabilitates abused, abandoned and neglected horses in Northern New Mexico, have the opportunity to help with fundraising and events, as well as working directly with the horses.</p>

<p><b>Randall Davey Audubon Center and Sancturary </b><em>(800 Upper Canyon Road, 983-4609)</em>, For nature lover’s, the Randall Davey Audubon Center and Sancturary is looking for volunteers to help in the visitor’s center and assist with landscaping and trail work, and even serve as Natural History Education and Field Biology assistants.</p>

<p><b>Many Mothers </b><em>(1824 Tewa Road, 983-5984)</em> is a local nonprofit that gives free in-house assistance to mothers and families with newborns. The organization matches volunteers with mothers and families through an interview and selection process. The assistance provided depends on the mother’s needs and can range from helping with household tasks and coaching in new parenting to doing grocery shopping or holding the baby while Mom reads to a sibling, gets some exercise or takes a nap.</p>

<p>A popular choice for those wanting to help the greater good, <b>The Food Depot </b><em>(1222 Siler Road, 471-1633)</em> is Santa Fe’s food bank, and it relies heavily on volunteer support to operate.
