<p class="pull-quote-long">Santa Fe is for everybody, a place where people feel a sense of belonging, no matter their economic background, ethnic origin, sexual orientation or where they come from; here people join together as a community to become one family in the City Different.</p>


<p>I have the privilege as mayor to improve the lives of our residents, to strengthen community bonds that connect and lift up families, and to make our city the most attractive place for people to visit, live, grow and make memories.</p>

<p>Founded in 1610, Santa Fe is the nation’s oldest capital city with over 400 years of history. Our city celebrates like no other in America. Our past blends together Native American, Hispanic and Anglo cultures whose traditions have flourished through hundreds of years. Fiestas de Santa Fe is the oldest continuous celebration in the country that rejoices the culture and history of Santa Fe.</p>

<div class="galim" title="Beekeeper" style="width: 200px; float: right; margin: 0 0 10px 10px; border: none;"><img src="http://sfr.gd/imgs/media.images/126/SillsPe_36.jpg" width="200" height="300"><div class="Credits" style="text-align: right;"><i><font face="georgia">Sills</font></i></div></div>

<p>As a child growing up here, my family traditionally attended the Fiestas de Santa Fe. I remember the incredible food on the Plaza and the annual Desfile De Los Niños or the Pet Parade. In 1989, I served as Don Diego de Vargas in Fiestas de Santa Fe and now as a father I am experiencing the celebration through the eyes of my children. Santa Fe is a community that shares celebrations like Fiestas de Santa Fe loaded with activities like Zozobra, mariachi music, parades, eating Navajo tacos on the Plaza and attending religious ceremonies that bring people and families together to make lasting memories.</p>

<p>Our historic Plaza bustles all year long with activities that include world-famous art markets like Indian Market and Spanish Market and others. We have a Summer Bandstand that offers free live music and dancing. We celebrate the Fourth of July with pancakes, and there are antique car shows, museums, art galleries, spectacular shopping and fantastic restaurants.</p>

<p>One of my favorite memories growing up was eating a Frito pie purchased from Woolworth’s and sitting on a Plaza park bench on a sunny day watching people cruise the streets. It’s a memory and a tradition that I can still enjoy today.</p>

<p>I have 15-year-old and 9-year-old daughters and we regularly have date nights that are commemorated with a selfie to create electronic memories of our adventures. Family is the most important thing in my life.</p>

<p>I value each and every minute spending time and doing things with my family.</p>

<p>In our great city, there are many opportunities to enjoy with your family and friends. I encourage you to explore our 400 years of history and create your own memorable life experiences in the City Different. Our city truly is an amazing and special place with so much to see and do. Go out and make a memory in Santa Fe.</p>
