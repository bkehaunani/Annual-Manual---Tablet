<p class="pull-quote-short">Santa Fe pulls you in and strips down your layers, they say. It’s a place where people from industries around the world come to leave past careers and start anew.</p>

<p>Some talk of the transformative energy of the high desert, and others call it responding to boredom, but no matter how you think of it, there is no way around the fact that Santa Fe is full of individuals making and seeking to make a career move. And although small in size, the city offers a surprising variety of options for those in search of a more creative, spiritual or more interesting path.</p>

<p>Santa Fe is known for its spas, and for its abundance of high-caliber bodyworkers. As a result, the <b>Santa Fe School of Massage</b> <em>(1091 Siler Road, (866) 505-2006)</em> is a popular choice for a career change. The school offers full-time massage therapy certification programs that prepare students, upon completion of the 700-hour training, to immediately re-enter the workforce in a profitable profession. In addition to traditional Western massage, students take anatomy, physiology and kinesiology courses, Oriental Medicine Theory and Shiatsu, and energy modules. They leave with a well-rounded understanding of Eastern and Western manual therapy and healing practices, and extensive knowledge to safely and expertly work with the human body.</p>

<p>For those seeking a more artistic path, the <b>Santa Fe University of Art and Design’s Film School</b> <em>(1600 St. Michaels Drive, 473-6011)</em> provides the possibility to go back to college at a relatively affordable rate, and with the opportunity for scholarship and financial aid. The school is highly popular not only because of the city’s deeply-rooted fine arts community and its history in the movie world, but also because the program is producing successful filmmakers; <em>Vanity</em> recently voted the film school among the Top 15 media programs in the country. Another perk of the program is that upon acceptance, students are given a high-end Canon camera and zoom lens to keep.</p>

<p>The popularity of yoga has spread like wildfire across the country in the last decade, both as a practice and as a potential new career. Santa Fe has a relatively large number of important yoga teachers given its size and even offers training programs for individuals wishing to deepen their spiritual or physical practice, or who are simply tired of their day job. Nationally recognized yoga teachers Josh Schrei and Shawn Parell of <b>BODY of Santa Fe lead Yoga School</b> <em>(333 W Cordova, 987-0632)</em>, a Yoga-Alliance certified program that offers 200- and 500-hour trainings to prepare students to teach yoga. Trainings are offered in both weekend-module and intensive formats to accommodate students visiting from around the country and those who are working a 9-to-5 job.</p>
