<p class="pull-quote-short">Our regional recycling rate has room to grow.</p>


<p>To those of you who are diligently separating your waste from your recycling, thank you! If more folks joined you, Santa Fe could actually reach the national recycling rate of 34 percent. This would really be something to boast about, since our current rate is 9 percent. While rate incentives and increased access could increase our recycling rate, each citizen has a responsibility as well.</p>

<p>The city of Santa Fe provides free curbside recycling with a $12.96 per month trash collection fee. Each home gets one 96-gallon trash can, which is picked up once a week. If you are the average American consumer, tossing 4 1/2 pounds of trash per day, that can will weigh more than 30 pounds at the end of the week. Why not divvy up your load by using at least two small recycling bins? Bins can be picked up at 1142 Siler Road from 8 am to 5 pm on weekdays and will easily fit into a car.  Conversely, you can call 955-2200 for information about events where officials will distribute bins.</p>

<div class="pull-sidebar">

	<p>Whether you are a full-time resident or just here for a visit, you can participate in the recycling system by separating some items before they go into your trash can.</p>
	
	<p>Recycling is a fast-growing, sustainable industry, fueled by an ever-increasing demand, and used to make quality products all over the world. Don’t let your valuable items be left out!</p>

		<li>About 80% of our trash in the US could be diverted by recycling, reusing or composting. (EPA)</li>
		<li>5 plastic bottles can be recycled into one XL T-shirt or 1 square foot of carpet.</li>
		<li>Recycling one aluminum can save enough energy to power your tv for 3 hours.</li>

<p><span class="heading">How to sort your recycling</span></p>

<p>In one bin, you will toss all of your No. 1 and No. 2 plastic bottles, tin cans, aluminum cans and paper. No. 1 plastic is clear and flimsy (e.g., water and Sprite bottles), while No. 2 plastic is thicker and closer to opaque (like a milk jug or detergent bottle). The second bin will be strictly for glass bottles. Do not mix glass bottles with other recyclables as it can endanger collection and processing staff and degrade the final baled products. Between the bins, stack your flattened cardboard. All curbside recyclables are taken to the Buckman Road Recycling &amp; Transfer Station for processing.</p>

<p>The station is operated by the Santa Fe Solid Waste Management Agency, a partnership of the city and county. Most of your recyclables are sorted, separated and compacted into bales there that are then sold to end-markets, companies that use your material to make new products. Your glass bottles are crushed outside of the building for recycling and use in local projects</p>


<p>Buckman Road Recycling and Transfer Station is a 10-minute drive from downtown Santa Fe and accepts many items for recycling that are not accepted curbside. Electronics, hazardous waste (including motor oil and antifreeze), yard debris, tires and scrap metal can all be taken to the station for responsible recycling. Hours and details on acceptable materials can be found at www.sfswma.org.</p>

<p>If you are a resident of Santa Fe County, you can purchase a $75 24-trip punch card to responsibly dispose of your trash at one of the county’s seven transfer stations. Your basic household recyclables can be dropped off for free. The Eldorado Transfer Station even includes a “reuse area” for customers to take or leave items. Even better, meet with your neighbors to start recycling together. Combine trips to the transfer station or thrift store to drop off unwanted items. Visit <a href="http://santafecountynm.gov" target="_blank">santafecountynm.gov</a> for hours and locations of all transfer stations.</p>
