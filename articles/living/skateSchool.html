<p class="pull-quote-short">Local school proves skateboarding is ready for the masses.</p>

<p>The first thing to know about <b>Timeship Skateboard School</b> <em>(825 Early Street, 474-0074)</em> is that it is hard to find. Tucked in back of the warehouse space off Early Street, the school is worth searching for. Inside awaits a 2,100 square-foot indoor skate park and workshop–a virtual shrine to the history and art of skateboarding. And all are welcome to pay tribute.  That’s because skateboarding is not just for the unwashed teenage masses anymore. “Skating has been around long enough now that I get grandparents and grandkids,” says founder Joe Lehm, who opened the school in 2001.</p>

<p>He also gets older professionals, from bankers to radiologists to pilots, looking to brush up their skills with private lessons or blow off steam with a free skate during lunch. “We’re like a gym,” he says.  The school’s primary goal is to teach safety skills, though. Stepping through the door to the school’s giant bowled ramp, all are greeted by the “Wall of Protection,” a photo display of proper safety gear and technique. “A common thing we hear is, ‘Oh, I got hurt, so I’ll never do that again.’ But if you learn your safety skills and keep them ahead of your skateboard skills, then you won’t get hurt and you’ll continue to have fun.”  For a generation of new riders who grew up on Tony Hawk Pro Skater video games, Lehm is also quick to stress the variety of styles there are to learn. The school offers private lessons and summer camps in the familiar street and vertical styles, but also longboarding and downhill racing.</p>

<p>That may be starting to change, though, as the school recently welcomed a team of seven downhill racers from Texas for private lessons in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. Lehm calls it “skateboard tourism.” A trip to Santa Fe’s own skateboarding shrine, you could call it a pilgrimage.</p>

<p>While Santa Fe may lag behind other cities when it comes to the number of skate parks, it still has two quality options for students trying to finish their homework.</p>

<p><b>De Vargas Park</b><br><i>(302 W De Vargas St)</i></p>

<p>As Santa Fe’s original skate park, De Vargas used to be so primitive it was voted worst skate park in America by <em>Thrasher</em> magazine – twice. Luckily, what’s old is new again. After a complete demo in 2013, this renovated street plaza is now the ideal spot to try your hand at street style.</p>

<p><b>Gen. Franklin E. Miles Park</b><br><i>(1027 Camino Carlos Rey)</i></p>

<p>While it may be “skating in captivity” for Joe Lehm and other old-school riders, modern skate parks offer everything skaters could want. Long gone are the days when enterprising kids had to drain a pool to get vertical. Today, Franklin Miles offers ready-made bowls that are perfect for going big (as long as you’re wearing your helmet).</p>
