<p class="pull-quote-med">Navigating the more than 100 galleries, boutiques and restaurants in less than a mile along Santa Fe’s Canyon Road can seem a daunting process that involves much strategy and watch syncing.</p>


<p class="p1">Those looking to stroll along with a sense of awe—not intimidation—should ditch their cars. The free Santa Fe Pick-Up shuttle runs every 15 minutes and offers two stops on Canyon Road and a third nearby at Alameda and Paseo de Peralta. Those already driving should park and walk. Public lots are available on the lower end of Canyon Road in three places: off Paseo del Peralta, next to <b>Kakawa Chocolate House</b> <i>(1050 Paseo de Peralta, 982-0388)</i>—a worthy stop in its own right for decadent truffles and elixirs—and two off Canyon, just shy of Delgado and Garcia Streets. A fourth public (paid) parking lot lies on the east end of Canyon at 777 Canyon Road. <b>The Teahouse</b> <i>(821 Canyon Road, 992-0972)</i> and <b>Café des Artistes</b> <i>(223 Canyon Road, 820-2535)</i> bookend the road, offering two places for respite and light fare. Finally, two of the city’s attraction-worthy restaurants, <b>The Compound </b><i>(653 Canyon Road, 982-4353)</i> and <b>Geronimo Restaurant</b> <i>(724 Canyon Road, 982-1500)</i> serve memorable fine-dining meals to cap off the day.</p>

<h2 class="subheads">Off Canyon Road</h2>

<p>With more than 250 art galleries in Santa Fe, a substantive portion lie away from Canyon Road. Many are divvied into two equally walkable neighborhoods: downtown and the Railyard District. Lest visitors spend the entire afternoon browsing for a parking spot instead of art, here are a few recommendations: Public (paid) lots are available at 100 E Water St., 215 Cathedral Place; 251 E Alameda St.; and Camino de la Familia and Paseo de Peralta at the Railyard. Parking garages are also available at 216 W San Francisco St. and 119 S Federal Place (at the Santa Fe Community Convention Center), both downtown, and at 503 Camino de la Familia at the Railyard. Because the Railyard boasts ample parking, it’s a fitting jumping-off point. The Plaza is just a few blocks away, but if walking is a concern, the free Santa Fe Pick-Up shuttle runs every 15 minutes, circuiting the Railyard, Canyon Road and several downtown drop-off points. Numerous restaurants are within sight, including New Mexico favorites such as Tomasita’s <i>(500 S Guadalupe St., 983-5721)</i>, a beacon in the Railyard, and iconic The Shed <i>(113 E Palace Ave., 982-9030).</i><br>
