<h2 class="intro">Make your way to a museum</h2>

<p><b><br></b></p><p><b>The New Mexico History Museum</b> is the ideal jumping-off point to delve into the state’s past and present. Celebrating its fifth year in 2014, the museum presents an interactive tour from formative Native cultures, through Spanish occupation to today’s New Mexico. The museum has gems around every turn: Take the stairs to the lower level slowly to listen to recorded congressional sessions debating the merits—or lack thereof—of New Mexico statehood. Two side-by-side exhibits are headlining the temporary offerings this year. <em>Poetics of Light: Pinhole Photography </em>showcases the museum’s collection of pinhole images and features a camera obscura with which visitors can experience the time-tested optical principle. “The photos are alternatingly beautiful and bizarre, and together [they] create an alternate sense of reality,” says Kate Nelson, museum spokeswoman. The second noteworthy exhibit, <em>Painting the Divine: Images of Mary</em> in the New World, displays 30 paintings from the permanent collection to demonstrate how faith anchored colonists in remote frontiers and how the depiction of Mary evolved in these new environs.

<p>The adjacent <b>Palace of the Governors</b> is the museum’s finest showpiece. Built in 1610 by Spanish explorers, the palace has been in continuous public use longer than any other structure in the US. Don’t miss the print shop and bindery, where limited-edition works are produced on hand-operated presses. Outside the palace, local artisans sell jewelry through the Portal Native American Artisans Program, which certifies that artisans are members of local tribes and pueblos.</p>

<p><em>Visitors planning to visit NMHM and other Museum of New Mexico institutions should purchase a four-day pass, which gives admission to the history museum, the Museum of Art, the Museum of International Folk Art and the Museum of Indian Arts &amp; Culture at a discounted rate of $20.</em> </p>
