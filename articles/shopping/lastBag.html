<p>The City of Santa Fe imposed a new law in 2014 prohibiting the distribution of thin, single-use plastic bags at the checkout counter. Stores can still give you a paper bag, but the idea was for shoppers to snap to the idea of bringing their own. SFR and our advertisers have distributed more than 200 reusable bags so far during the Â¡Adios Plastico! campaign.</p>
