<p class="pull-quote-small">Boston’s marathon is world famous for its Heartbreak Hill. New York City’s lures more than 50,000 runners each year. But Santa Fe’s biggest footrace has an allure all its own.</p>

<p>Runners, joggers and even race-walkers will pound away from Fort Marcy Recreation Complex again this September for the fourth annual Santa Fe Thunder half-marathon. Race promoters Joseph Karnes and Abraham Kosgei of Global Running Culture say about 750 participants completed the picturesque 13.1-mile course last year.</p><p>

</p><p>Race day also features shorter distances, including a 5K race and a kids “Global Footprints” course.
