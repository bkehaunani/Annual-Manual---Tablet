<h3 class="subhead"> Ridin' That Train</h3>

<p>New Mexico’s Rail Runner Express trains began delivering passengers between Santa Fe and Albuquerque in 2008. Now, you can ride all the way from the downtown Santa Fe depot near Tomasita’s restaurant to the end of the line in the small ranching community of Belen, south of the Duke City. A short shuttle ride will even carry you from the Albuquerque Alvarado depot to the Albuquerque International Sunport.</p><p></p>

<p>Train fares vary depending on where you board and get off, children under 9 ride for free, students and seniors can get to ABQ for $4, and it’s $9 full adult fare for a basic trip from the City Different to Albuquerque. Riders experience scenes that you just can’t get from I-25, including up close views of San Felipe and Santo Domingo pueblos, the Rio Grande, La Bajada mesa and more. There’s free wi-fi for most of the route, plenty of room for restless kids, and best, that gentle rocking of the steel wheels on the rails – all while reducing the carbon footprint of individual travel.
