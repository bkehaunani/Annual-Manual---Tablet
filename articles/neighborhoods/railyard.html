<p>The Railyard could very well be is the best place to fully submerse yourself in the creative, diverse culture of Santa Fe.</p>


<p>The smell of freshly baked breads and pies, organic produce, lavender, green chile and wood fire smoke waft through the Saturday morning air at the Farmers Market <em>(1607 Paseo de Peralta #1, 983-4098)</em>. And it’s not just for eating. Shearling rugs and other exquisite interior-design pieces accompany natural stone jewelry. Each vendor uses the market as an opportunity to celebrate “what they do… and [to] spread the enthusiasm,” says an assistant for Victoria Adams of Mother Earth Art, which specializes in intricate landscapes you’ll have to see to believe.</p>


<p>Experience even more Santa Fe vibes thereafter by jumping into an African dance or Kundalini yoga class offered at the Railyard Performance Center <em>(1611 Paseo de Peralta, 982-8309). </em>Move to some live music or regain your center all before getting knee deep into a market where the city’s characters are ever present.</p>

<p>“I do gaudy best. If you can’t see it from the highway, why wear it?”<em> </em>says Roberta, a jewelry vendor at Trader Walt’s Southwestern and International Market <em>(555 Camino de la Familia, 982-2671)</em> who takes credit for the gathering’s nickname, The Flea.  Her booth inside the El Museo building is filled with quirky handmade jewelry as colorful as her own aura. “The Flea…is a social ‘must-do’ in Santa Fe,” says founder Walt Borton himself.</p>


<p>Searching the nooks and crannies of The Flea will definitely cause you to work up an appetite. From there, The Flying Star <em>(500 Market St., 216-3939)</em> is a wonderful stop to refuel. Not only is the food delicious and creative, but if you’re an avid people watcher, you will want to stay for hours. </p>


<p>After some grub, watch a movie or grab a couple drinks in the newly opened bar at the Jean Cocteau Theater <em>(418 Montezuma Ave., 466-5528)</em>, owned by Game of Thrones author George RR Martin. While the theater has been drawing crowds to free airings of the HBO show based on his books, it also shows quirky sci-fi and a host of other films. </p>


<p>Whether you’re in the mood for organic and natural, expressive and cultural or quirky and creative, this newly renovated city-owned land holds hidden gems.</p>
