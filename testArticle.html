<p class="p1"><span class="drop-cap">F</span></p>rom the mystic origins of “the Force” to Princess Leia’s iconic Hopi-inspired squashblossom whorl hairstyle, Native American culture is often associated with elements of George Lucas’ <i>Star Wars</i> series. On Friday, these similarities come full circle, as the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.indianartsandculture.org/">Museum of Indian Arts &amp; Culture</a>, in partnership with the Navajo Nation Museum, presents <i>Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope</i> dubbed in Navajo.&nbsp;<p></p><p></p>








<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The 1977 space opera was the first installment in the epic sci-fi series (until the prequels came out in 1999, that is). It tells the story of a galaxy immersed in civil war and the Rebel Alliance that plots to take the Galactic Empire’s Death Star down.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The screening launches the MIAC’s <i>Native Film Series</i>, which aims to showcase two films a month inside the museum’s Kathryn O’Keeffe Theater.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“There’s only a handful of venues across the country that focus on Native films,” Jhane Myers, the cultural institution’s Native film and culture programmer tells SFR. “If we can get a good response and the general public wants to see Native films, this will be a great place for it.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Native-owned Knifewing Productions dubbed the Diné audio in its Gallup recording studio, marking the first time a major motion picture has received the Navajo treatment.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Myers’ connections, acquired during her decade-long work in film, as well a previous stint in the National Museum of the American Indian, were instrumental in securing the movie for its Santa Fe premiere.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The move, she says, was designed as a way of furthering the preservation of indigenous languages.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The cross-generational appeal of the film, she hopes, seals the deal.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I love <i>Star Wars</i> and I have a 15-year-old son,” Myers says. “Not only was <i>Star Wars</i> an important part of my life when I was young, but I have continued to live and breathe it through my son.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Those not fluent shant worry, as it is subtitled in English.</span></p>
